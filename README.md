## **Overview**

This is a React application designed to showcase various small-scale web projects that I've worked on. It's intended for single-page projects to be housed on one website.

The purpose of the application is for myself to gain experience designing with Tailwind, as well as being a reference point for some cool projects I've worked on.

## **Tech Stack**

The application itself is built on Vite with Typescript React, using Tailwind along with some custom css for styling and animations.
